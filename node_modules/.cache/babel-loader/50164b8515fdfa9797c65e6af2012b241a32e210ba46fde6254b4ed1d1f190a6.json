Because of their remote location on the east coast, these beaches are nearly\n                        always deserted. In addition, the view is spectacular.  Trincomalee beach is busy, with traditional,\n                         colorful fishing boats and residents throwing their nets right off the beach. \n                         There are also some wonderful beach bars where you can sit on swings and select from a\n                          variety of delicious beverages.</p>\n                        <img src={trincoimg} className='blog-design'alt=\"Trincomalee Beach\" />\n                    </Col> \n                    </div>\n\n                    <br />\n                    <h3>5.

It's a little more difficult to get to because it's off the \n                        regular Sri Lanka itinerary, but it's well worth the effort! Tangalle has less tourists, \n                        resulting in a more serene experience (you'll note that the region only has a few prominent resorts).</p>\n                        <img src={tangimg} className='blog-design'alt=\"Tangalle Beach\" />\n                    </Col> \n                    </div>\n\n                </Container>\n            </Fragment>\n        )\n    }\n}\n\nexport default BlogBeach"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,IAAIC,SAAS,EAAEC,QAAQ,QAAQ,OAAO;AAClD,SAASC,SAAS,EAAEC,GAAG,QAAO,iBAAiB;AAC/C,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,4BAA4B;AAC/C,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,4BAA4B;AAC/C,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,4BAA4B;AAC/C,OAAOC,SAAS,MAAM,+BAA+B;AACrD,OAAOC,OAAO,MAAM,6BAA6B;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAGjD,MAAMC,SAAS,SAASX,SAAS,CAAC;EAC9BY,MAAMA,CAAA,EAAG;IACL,oBACIF,OAAA,CAACT,QAAQ;MAAAY,QAAA,eAELH,OAAA,CAACR,SAAS;QAAAW,QAAA,gBAENH,OAAA,CAACP,GAAG;UAACW,EAAE,EAAE,EAAG;UAAAD,QAAA,gBACRH,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLR,OAAA;YAAIS,KAAK,EAAE;cAAEC,SAAS,EAAE,QAAQ;cAAEC,UAAU,EAAE;YAAO,CAAE;YAAAR,QAAA,EAAC;UAAiD;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC9GR,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLR,OAAA;YAAGS,KAAK,EAAE;cAAEC,SAAS,EAAE;YAAU,CAAE;YAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;UAMU;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACjDR,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACVR,OAAA;YAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;UAA6C;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACjD,CAAC,eAENR,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,eAEAH,OAAA,CAACP,GAAG;YAACW,EAAE,EAAE,EAAG;YAAAD,QAAA,gBACRH,OAAA;cAAGS,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEC,SAAS,EAAE;cAAU,CAAE;cAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;YAIsC;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC3ER,OAAA;cAAKY,GAAG,EAAElB,MAAO;cAACmB,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;cAACC,GAAG,EAAC;YAAc;cAAAT,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAE,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACjE;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACD,CAAC,eAGNR,OAAA;UAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eACNR,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAA6B;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACtCR,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,eACAH,OAAA,CAACP,GAAG;YAACW,EAAE,EAAE,EAAG;YAAAD,QAAA,gBACRH,OAAA;cAAGS,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEC,SAAS,EAAE;cAAU,CAAE;cAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;YAMpC;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;cAAKY,GAAG,EAAEjB,MAAO;cAACkB,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;cAAAC,GAAG,EAAC;YAAe;cAAAT,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAE,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAC9D;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACD,CAAC,eAGNR,OAAA;UAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eACNR,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAA+B;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACxCR,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,eACAH,OAAA,CAACP,GAAG;YAACW,EAAE,EAAE,EAAG;YAAAD,QAAA,gBACRH,OAAA;cAAGS,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEC,SAAS,EAAE;cAAU,CAAE;cAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;YAMiC;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACzER,OAAA;cAAKY,GAAG,EAAEhB,MAAO;cAACiB,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;cAAAC,GAAG,EAAC;YAAiB;cAAAT,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAE,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAChE;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACD,CAAC,eAENR,OAAA;UAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eACNR,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAAoB;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC7BR,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,eACAH,OAAA,CAACP,GAAG;YAACW,EAAE,EAAE,EAAG;YAAAD,QAAA,gBACRH,OAAA;cAAGS,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEC,SAAS,EAAE;cAAU,CAAE;cAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;YAKH;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACrCR,OAAA;cAAKY,GAAG,EAAEf,SAAU;cAACgB,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;cAAAC,GAAG,EAAC;YAAmB;cAAAT,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAE,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACrE;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACD,CAAC,eAENR,OAAA;UAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eACNR,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAAiB;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC1BR,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,eACAH,OAAA,CAACP,GAAG;YAACW,EAAE,EAAE,EAAG;YAAAD,QAAA,gBACRH,OAAA;cAAGS,KAAK,EAAE;gBAAEC,SAAS,EAAE;cAAU,CAAE;cAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;YAGiE;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACzGR,OAAA;cAAKY,GAAG,EAAEd,OAAQ;cAACe,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;cAAAC,GAAG,EAAC;YAAgB;cAAAT,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAE,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAChE;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACD,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAEC;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACN,CAAC;EAEnB;AACJ;AAEA,eAAeP,SAAS"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
